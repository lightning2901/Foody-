# Introduction 
During years the information about food was only saved in books and food magazines, but in an era like ours, where the information is everywhere, people may have the need of accessing to new content, not only the social media or entertaiment data, but data that allow us to satisfy our needs, like hunger. So, using API's and a user interface, we want to let people the access to a great set of food recipes based on different variables or just a simple key word.
