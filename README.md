# Introduction 
During years the information about food was only saved in books and food magazines, but in an era like ours, where the information is everywhere, people may have the need of accessing to new content, not only the social media or entertaiment data, but data that allow us to satisfy our needs, like hunger. So, using API's and a user interface, we want to let people the access to a great set of food recipes based on different variables or just a simple key word. 

# Justification
In today's world, where time is a valuable resource and in some people there is an absence of creativity and imagination when cooking and healthy eating is a priority for many, there is a growing need for solutions that simplify planning. of meals and improve accessibility to personalized food options. This project proposes the development of an innovative digital tool designed to respond to this need, offering users personalized recipe recommendations based on the ingredients they have on hand, their culinary preferences, and their specific dietary needs.
