So, using API's and a user interface, we want to let people the access to a great set of food recipes based on different variables or just a simple key word to make an easy use for the users to be able to do it in a simple way.

There is a growing need for solutions and we plan to solve some of them with this project while also improve accessibility to personalized options. In short, we provide an innovative digital tool designed to respond to these needs.
